Linux rootkit, working in 3.2.11 on arch

I started to make this becuase there is very little about writing malicious kernel modules online and especially nothing for later kernels.
Lots of information came from reading the enye rootkit (http://www.ossec.net/rootkits/enye-sec.php)

This is a loadable kernel module, use at your own risk, can crash your system.
I will not provide instructions for use, if you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't be using this.
This is also not permanent, post reboot it is no longer loaded I do not intend to change this for the forseeable future.
Functions:
    - Give a caller root privs by calling kill with pid 12345 and sig 58
    - Hides self from lsmod (currently turned off)
    - Hides files from a list (incomplete)
Low level capabilities:
    - Find syscall table
    - Hijack syscall functions

THIS ROOTKIT IS NOT COMPLETE YET
