Linux rootkit, working in 3.2.11 on arch
This is a loadable kernel module, use at your own risk, can crash your system.
I will not provide instructions for use, if you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't be using this.
Functions:
    - Give a caller root privs by calling kill with pid 12345 and sig 58
    - Hides self from lsmod (currently turned off)
    - Hides files from a list (incomplete)
Low level capabilities:
    - Find syscall table
    - Hijack syscall functions

THIS ROOTKIT IS NOT COMPLETE YET
